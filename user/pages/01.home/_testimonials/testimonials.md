    quote: Sometimes, I felt like I lost confidence and my advantages. Fortunately, I met Tedra Cobb and had her ELS class the whole summer before [the] MBA program started. In her class, we were not only learning languages, but also American culture, and the American logic to communicate. After several months, my English and communication skills improved dramatically. I felt I was ready and confident for the MBA challenges. During the whole learning process, I had upset moments when it was hard to understand lots of idioms and slang. And every time, Tedra cheered me up and encouraged me a lot. For me, Tedra is not only a language teacher, but a mentor in my life.
